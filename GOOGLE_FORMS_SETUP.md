### Step 2: Configure Email Notifications

For each form:

2. Click the three dots (â‹®) â†’ "Get email notifications for new responses"
3. Enable notifications so you get emails when people submit

### Step 3: Get Form Entry IDs

For each form, you need to get the entry IDs:

1. Open your form
2. Click "Preview" (eye icon)
3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to Network tab
5. Fill out and submit the form
6. Look for the network request to `formResponse`
7. Copy the entry IDs from the form data

**Example of what you'll see:**
```
entry.123456789: John
entry.987654321: Doe
entry.456789123: john@example.com
```

### Step 4: Update the Code

Open `src/lib/google-forms.ts` and replace the placeholder values:

```typescript
const GOOGLE_FORMS_CONFIG = {
  memberRegistration: {
    formId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_FORM_ID_HERE', // From the form URL
    fields: {
      firstName: 'entry.YOUR_ENTRY_ID',
      lastName: 'entry.YOUR_ENTRY_ID',
      email: 'entry.YOUR_ENTRY_ID',
      // ... etc
    }
  },
  // ... repeat for other forms
};
```

### Step 5: Set Up Google Sheets (Automatic)

Google automatically creates a spreadsheet for each form:
1. In your form, click "Responses" tab
2. Click the green Sheets icon to create a linked spreadsheet
3. This will contain all form submissions

### Step 6: Optional - Set Up Email Automation

You can create automated welcome emails using Google Apps Script:

1. In your Google Sheet, go to Extensions â†’ Apps Script
2. Add this code for automated emails:

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  const responses = e.values;
  const email = responses[2]; // Assuming email is in column C
  const firstName = responses[0]; // Assuming first name is in column A
  
  // Send welcome email
  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: email,
    subject: "Welcome to The Vet Tech Herd! ðŸŽ‰",
    htmlBody: `
      <h2>Welcome ${firstName}!</h2>
      <p>Thank you for joining The Vet Tech Herd community.</p>
      <p>We'll be in touch soon with next steps and upcoming events.</p>
      <p>Best regards,<br>The Vet Tech Herd Team</p>
